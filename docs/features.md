# Features Overview (Starter)

This starter includes:

- `example-feature/` – a minimal feature skeleton under `src/features/example-feature/`.
- `auth/` – a basic Supabase email login flow under `src/features/auth/` and
  `app/(auth)/login`.

Future projects should document real features here rather than creating
separate markdown files for each change.
